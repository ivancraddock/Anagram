# Anagram
A program that searches a hashed dictionary to find anagrams. By default, the program will read the file "input.txt" line-by-line and store every separate line inside a custom String object. The program will then search the file "dictionary.txt" to find any anagrams for those String objects, and output the results from that search to the file "output.txt". By default, "imput.txt" is loaded with some sample words to show proper formatting.

Instructions:

1.) Import this project into Eclipse. 

2.) Run the program named "Tester.java". 

2a.) To change the search parameters, modify "input.txt"
